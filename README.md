# da_pixel

This is a work in progress of a pixel-style clock (inspired by LaMetric TIME) for Raspberry PI, implemented with Flutter. This project uses [flame engine](https://flame-engine.org/) to emulate pixels on an HDMI display.

Follow the instructions here to compile --> https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi


The display in the sample is 8.8" / 1920x480px.

Tested with PI4, PI Zero 2 W
